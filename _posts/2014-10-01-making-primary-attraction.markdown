At Primary Attraction, we build websites with the best tools available.  Our goal is to make websites that - in addition to perfectly expressing your brand and effectively serving your business objectives-  are beautiful, fast, and delightful to use.  

All our websites are built from scratch, static and responsive.  That means they're custom designed, super secure, fast to load and capable of handling lots of traffic,(important for when your marketing campaign goes viral!), and look good on all screens including phones and ipads.

We're really into software, and are constantly trying out new tools to make sure we are using the best available platforms and services to build our sites and manage marketing campaigns.  Today we are going to share the tools used to make primaryattraction.com - the same ones we use to make all our clients' sites.  Right now, to us, these are the best of the best.

####**Tools and services we use and love for making websites.**

We build all our sites using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) for **content management**.  Jekyll allows for full control of design and structure, and it's easy to integrate the tools and services we use.  We can build quickly and efficiently, and it's easy to iterate and evolve the site over time. 

We use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a foundation to **style** the front end (what people see) of the site.  

The **contact forms** we make are powered by [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/), our favorite customer relationship management tool.  When someone submits a form, it automatically creates a lead in capsule, and sends a notification email.  Perfect!

[Campaign Monitor](http://campaignmonitor.com) is definitely our favorite software for **newsletters**. Beautiful look and feel for your emails and well thought out list management, as well as great analytics. It's actually FUN making newsletters with Campaign Monitor!

We use [Addthis](http://www.addthis.com/) to power the **social sharing buttons** on the blog.

[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) powers blog **commenting**.

For **ecommerce**, we use [FoxyCart](http://foxycart.com) and [Stripe](http://stripe.com). Secure, reliable and simple pricing with no weird fees.

All the site **files and code are stored** on [Github](http://www.github.com). Github saves a version history of the website - every time changes are made, a version is saved - and backs up all the files in the cloud.

We **host** our sites on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), a global content delivery network that powers many of the worlds leading websites.  It takes a little more work to setup, but when it really counts - when your website is getting mobbed with traffic when a post goes viral, or you get mentioned on Oprah - S3 will be able to handle it. 

We use [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/) for **email**.

Once the site is published, we use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to **analyze and measure** a range of metrics to help us optimize the site and guide our marketing strategy.

At this point we also like to generate a brand **style guide** using [Stylify Me](http://stylifyme.com).  Now we have a handy reference for font styles and colors!

That's everything we used to build this website.  Thanks to everyone out there working hard developing these amazing tools and services.  With these resources, there's never been a better (or more fun!) time to build a business online.  We truly love making websites, and we'd love to make yours.
