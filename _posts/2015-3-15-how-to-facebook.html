<p class="lead">Are you having trouble generating engagement with your Facebook posts?  Does it seem like hardly anyone even sees your posts let alone like or comment?</p>

<p>You are not alone.  With so much content competition, it's increasingly hard to communicate effectively and engage with your customers on Facebook.</p>

<p>At KILLIAN Jewelry, our Store Support team spends a great deal of time working with social media and figuring out how to get results.  We recently ran a Valentine's Day campaign on Facebook, and got some great results, read on to learn how we did it!</p>

<p>Our goal with this campaign was to attract new people to our <a href="http://facebook.com/killianjewelry" target="_blank">KILLIAN Jewelry Facebook page</a> and get them to  Facebook Like Button it while sharing a fun first experience with our brand.</p>

<p>We decided to do a giveaway, who doesn't love  those? We've learned that if you want to drive engagement - or interaction it's helpful to <strong>give something of value</strong>. You don't necessarily have to give away free product, you can give great content as well.</p>

<p>Next, we took a luscious picture of our giveaway bracelet with some other Valentine's themed props to create a <strong>compelling image</strong>.
</p>
<p>Then we created the post describing our giveaway and <strong>utilizing some </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/587836257914341" target="_blank">#hashtags</a>.  We took care to <strong>include a specific call to action</strong> that we wanted in exchange for a chance to win.  In our case, it was to like our page (because we are new and need more likes!) and share the post (because we wanted to get our brand in front of new people).
</p>
<p>Finally, we published the post and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/547448218658012/" target="_blank">boosted</a> it.   If you don't know what that is here's the deal: since there's so much content flowing around on Facebook, everyone can't see everything everyone posts.  Boosting posts is a way Facebook developed to allow businesses to make sure you get onto people's feeds and get your posts seen.  You have to pay, but it's not necessarily expensive, especially if you don't have large number of followers.  For our Valentine's promotion, we paid $20, which we felt was very reasonable for the results we got.  Over 14K people reached, 150+ post likes, 50+ new page likes, 23 comments and 122 shares!  For us as a small company just getting started on our national marketing this was a great success.
