    <p class="lead">According to Forbes, personal finance issue 2013, illness and medical appointments are the most commonly reported reasons for missing work. Not surprisingly, each year during the cold and flu season, there is a dramatic spike in absenteeism rates for both full-time and part-time employees.”

<p class="lead">
“Absenteeism costs U.S. companies billions of dollars each year in lost productivity, wages, poor quality of goods/services and excess management time.”
</p>

<p class="lead">It can be challenging for employers to effectively monitor, control and reduce absenteeism.  I realized how this negatively impacted by business when I was in the middle of everything falling apart all around me. This particular individual had been with me since the inception of my practice.  I look back now and realize that she stayed way too long!  I asked myself WHY? The reason I came up with is that it was just easier to keep her and work around her issues; after all she was a team player. As I began to look more closely, I could see the burden she put on my other employees.  They became frustrated with her and a saw a decline in morale that was </p>
<p class="lead">

This person became very controlling and territorial. I did not realize how sick this person actually was. I later found out what she was not doing and it ended up costing me thousands of dollars. So it is important for employers to consider the added costs associated with a sick employee who could not only spread an illness within the company but their quality of work can be detrimental to the company. Needless to say she is gone and the morale and organization of my business has tremendously improved, not to mention has costs me less in healthcare costs. I can honestly say that we have fun at Davis Endodontics, PC!,</p>
